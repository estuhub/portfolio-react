            <p>In October 2022, I graduated top of class from an 11-week Full Stack Web Development bootcamp in Koh Phangan, Thailand. Currently, I am working on a number of personal projects whilst starting a mentoring position with the same Bootcamp I graduated from. I love to travel and live in different countries; in the past 15 years I've lived in Argentina, Germany, Panama, Canada, and Thailand. With an analytical and numerical background, I am a fast learner and always looking to improve my skills. I am curious about new technologies and particularly interested in web design and single page applications.</p>
