            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I graduated top of the class Oct'22 as Full Stack Web Dev after completing 11 weeks of Bootcamp in Koh Phangan - Thailand. I also have an analytical and numerical background. I'm interested in web design and single page applications. I am currently working on a number of personal projects and starting a mentor position with the same Bootcamp I graduated from. I love travelling and living in different countries. In the past 15 years, I've lived in Argentina, Germany, Panama, Canada and Thailand. I am fast learner and very curious about new technologies, always looking to improve my skills.</p>
